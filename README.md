# SqliteDataBaseAndroidKotlin
SQLite is an open-source relational database that is used to perform database operations on Android devices such as storing, manipulating or retrieving persistent data from the database.

What is SQLite.
SQLite is a relational database management system, similar to Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server.
It implements most of the SQL standard, but unlike the four database engines mentioned above, it is not a client-server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program. What this means is that you can bundle a SQLite database with your application, and get access to all the power of a relational database within your application. SQLite is native to both Android and iOS, and every app can create and use an SQLite database if they so desire. In fact, in Android, device contacts, and media are stored and referenced using SQLite databases. An exciting tidbit of information is that SQLite is the most used database engine in the world, and quite possibly the most widely deployed software ever.

Preparation
Regular readers of this series will notice that we’ve recently begun using the Android data binding techniques for tutorials. If you are not familiar with the concept, check out my previous article discussing Android data binding. Also, we use recyclerview to display lists, as also discussed previously. You may want to read both if you aren’t familiar with the concepts.
